1. Download and extract preprocessing.rar
2. Copy the folder and paste it to your working directory make sure it is in the same level
3. 'pip install contractions'
4. Just import the preprocessing 'from .preprocessing import preprocess'
5. Now you can preprocess the text by calling the function like this:
   'preprocess.preprocess_text(input_text, 'with')' put 'with' for with emojis and emoticons
   and for without emojis and emoticons put 'without'
